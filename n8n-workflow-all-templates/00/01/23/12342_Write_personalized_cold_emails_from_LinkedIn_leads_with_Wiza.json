No fluff, no jargon, no hype.\n- Use only details implied or stated in the research_report.\n- Avoid repetitive phrases (\"replace SDRs\", \"$10.5k/month\", etc.).\n- Keep CTAs simple — \"full breakdown\" or \"the playbook\", not long lists of features\n- HTML rules: Use ONLY plain text and <br> tags for new lines. No other tags, no inline CSS, no images.\n\nDATA USAGE RULES (CRITICAL):\n- Use company-specific details ONLY if they're unlikely to change (domain, industry, hiring signal itself)\n- AVOID brittle details like exact headcount, revenue bands, or office locations unless critical to the angle\n- Frame case studies as \"similar-sized\" or \"similar-stage\" rather than exact matches\n- If you use company stage, keep it vague: \"companies hiring reps\" not \"11-person companies\"\n\nWORKFLOW\n1) ANCHOR on the hiring signal (they're scaling sales team = Tier 1)\n\n2) LAYER additional signals from research to determine template:\n   - Template A (Question-led): Hiring + additional Tier 1 signal (funding, exec change, tech stack shift)\n   - Template B (Direct value): Hiring + Tier 2 signal with strong case study match\n   - Template C (Hiring-focused): Hiring signal only, minimal other info\n\n3) FRAME the challenge as a QUESTION with specific cost/risk/urgency in the SECOND sentence\n\n4) INJECT credibility in the THIRD sentence (proof, case study, metric) — not buried at the end\n\n5) SHARPEN the CTA — keep it simple (\"full breakdown\", \"the playbook\", \"how we did it\")\n\n6) RUN final \"human check\" — would YOU reply to this?\n\n\n# TEMPLATE A (Question-led — hiring + additional Tier 1 signal)\n\nSubject: [first_name], [signal question]?\n\nHi [first_name],<br><br>\n\nSaw you're hiring [SDR/BDR roles] [+ additional signal] — [provocative question with $ cost/risk/urgency tied to BOTH signals]?<br><br>\n\nWe helped a [similar-stage] [industry] [achieve specific outcome] in [timeframe] without adding headcount — happy to share the playbook.<br><br>\n\nWant the [X-min] Loom?<br><br>\n\nBest,<br>\n[your_name]<br>\n[your_title], [your_company]\n\n\n# TEMPLATE B (Direct value — hiring + strong case study match)\n\nSubject: [outcome] for [company]\n\nHi [first_name],<br><br>\n\nSaw you're bringing on [SDR/BDR roles] [+ signal] — [question with cost/risk]?<br><br>\n\nWe helped a [similar-stage] [industry] go from [before_state] to [after_state] in [timeframe].

What's your backup plan if it takes 6+ months?<br><br>\n\nWe helped a similar-sized [industry] book [X meetings] in [timeframe] with AI-driven outreach while their new rep was still ramping — covered the full breakdown in a [X-min] Loom.<br><br>\n\nWant me to send it?<br><br>\n\nBest,<br>\n[your_name]<br>\n[your_title], [your_company]\n\n\nEXAMPLE (Template C refined):\n\nSubject: Andy, hiring SDRs?\n\nHi Andy,<br><br>\n\nSaw the SDR openings at RT Futures Group — most companies hiring reps right now are betting $150k+ per head on ramp time and quota attainment. What's your backup plan if it takes 6+ months?<br><br>\n\nWe helped a similar-sized wealth advisor book 12 meetings in 30 days with AI-driven outreach while their new rep was still ramping — covered the full breakdown in a 3-min Loom.<br><br>\n\nWant me to send it?<br><br>\n\nBest,<br>\nAlex<br>\nAI Transformation Partner, otomata.xyz\n\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- Subject lines: SHORT and punchy (4-6 words max) — \"Andy, hiring SDRs?\" not \"Andy — shorten SDR ramp with a 30-day meeting plan\"\n- SECOND sentence MUST be a provocative QUESTION with specific $ cost/risk/urgency\n- THIRD sentence MUST inject proof/case study with specific metrics (not buried later)\n- NEVER use generic phrases like \"Most small firms scaling reps face...\" or \"A lot of teams in your space...\"\n- AVOID exact headcount, revenue, or location unless absolutely necessary\n- Keep CTAs simple — \"full breakdown\", \"the playbook\", \"Want it?\" — not feature lists\n- ALWAYS reference the SDR/BDR hiring in the first sentence (it's your credibility hook)\n- Frame your solution as \"scale smarter\" not \"replace your hires\" (avoid making them defensive)\n- Vary phrasing — no two emails should feel identical",

The same thing is now happening with AI.\n\n---\n\n## Our Approach\n\nAt otomata.xyz, we act as **AI Transformation Partners (AITP)**:\n\n1. **Strategy & Roadmapping** — Identify where AI creates real value.\n2. **Team Education** — Upskill staff so adoption sticks.\n3. **Development & Partnership** — Build solutions only after the groundwork is solid.\n\n---\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n* **First audit:** free (lost \\$30k, but validated demand).\n* **Second audit:** \\$30k for 6 weeks.\n* **Third audit:** \\$60k for 4 weeks.\n\nCompanies aren’t asking for code first. They want clarity: *where to apply AI, and how not to fail.*\n\n---\n\n## Market Opportunity\n\n* AI consulting projected to grow from **\\$8.8B → \\$73B by 2033** (\\~30% YoY growth).\n* **78% of SMBs** want AI solutions.\n* **Only 5%** have access to consultants.\n\n---\n\n## Positioning\n\notomata.xyz exists to fill the mid-market gap: too small for big consultancies, too strategic for one-off AI agencies. We partner with companies that are ready to adopt AI the right way—strategy before code, education before tools, partnership before transactions.\n"
