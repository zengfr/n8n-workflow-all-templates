Welcome to the vibe coding revolution \\n Why Vibe Coding is Taking Over Software Development in 2025\\n Remember when coding meant wrestling with syntax errors at 2 AM? Those days are rapidly becoming history.\\n What is Vibe Coding?\\nCoined by AI visionary Andrej Karpathy earlier this year, vibe coding represents a fundamental shift in how we build software. Instead of writing code line by line, developers now describe what they want in plain English, and AI transforms those intentions into working applications.\\n Think of it as having a conversation with your computer:\\n Build me a social media dashboard that tracks engagement metrics\\\" → and the code just appears.\\n Why It's Exploding Right Now:\\n🔹 Accessibility Revolution: Non-technical professionals can now build functional software, democratizing development like never before\\n🔹 Efficiency Multiplier: Y Combinator's Garry Tan notes that vibe coding allows 10 engineers to do the work of 100, transforming startup economics\\n🔹 Perfect Timing: AI tools like Cursor, Replit Agent, and Windsurf have matured beyond simple autocomplete to full end-to-end development\\n🔹 Market Adoption: 44% of developers have already adopted AI coding tools, with adoption accelerating monthly\\n The Real Impact:\\nStartups are shrinking development teams from 50+ engineers to 5-10 core architects. Students and kids are building complex applications that previously required computer science degrees. The barrier between having an idea and making it real has never been lower.\\n Is This Just Hype?\\nWhile skeptics question sustainability, the numbers don't lie. This isn't about replacing developers—it's about amplifying human creativity and removing technical friction from innovation.\\n The future of software isn't about who can write the most elegant loops. It's about who can best articulate problems and solutions.\\n What do you think? Are you experimenting with vibe coding in your projects?\\n #VibeCoding #AI #SoftwareDevelopment #Innovation #TechTrends #Automation #StartupLife\"\n\n}\n",

Start a chat or trigger it from another workflow with a topic + summary.  \n2. The LinkedIn Agent asks what kind of post you want (Educational, Discussion, Promotion, etc.).  \n3. A Switch node selects the right prompt template.  \n4. The Post Generator agent runs quality checks and calls Mistral to produce the final post text.  \n5. The post is returned for review or publication.\n\n## Setup steps\n1. Add your **Mistral Cloud credentials** in the credentials manager.  \n2. Optionally connect another workflow to pass in “topic” and “template” values.  \n3. Run the chat trigger or execute manually to test.  \n4. Review the generated post in the output.\n\n💡 Tip: Templates are customizable — open each “Set” node to edit tone, structure, or examples.\n"
