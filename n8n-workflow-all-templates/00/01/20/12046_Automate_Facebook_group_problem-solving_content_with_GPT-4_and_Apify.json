Identify candidate problems whenever a member expresses frustration, asks “how do I…?”, vents, or repeats a struggle.  \n3. Answer these key questions to guide your research:  \n   - What topics are people discussing?  \n   - What challenges are they encountering?  \n   - What solutions do they prefer?  \n   - What specific language, acronyms, or key phrases do they use?  \n4. Consolidate duplicates, keeping the member’s original phrasing as evidence.  \n5. Rank problems based on:  \n   - Frequency (appears in many threads)  \n   - Intensity (strong emotion, urgent language)  \n   - Monetizability (can a paid solution reasonably solve it?)  \n6. Map each problem to one or more of these master categories:  \n   - 01-Lead_Generation  \n   - 02-Founder_Overwhelm  \n   - 03-Project_Chaos  \n   - 04-Sales_Process  \n   - 05-Referral_Dependency  \n   - 06-No_Offer  \n   - 07-Unclear_Messaging  \n   - 08-Messy_Ops  \n   - 09-Bad_Software  \n   - 10-Client_Retention  \n7.

Build an Audience Snapshot, including:  \n   - Titles, company stages, revenue clues  \n   - Mindset (stressed, hopeful, burnt-out)  \n   - Dominant desires  \n\n\nQUALITY BAR:\n- Use members’ exact words for problems (short direct quotes).  \n- Avoid generic statements; every item must refer to an actual conversation.  \n-Use the think to to help you when you need to make hard decisions.\n- Ensure the Language Bank covers at least 90% of recurring jargon.  \n- Complete and accurate Category Map.  \n- Post Hints should feel native to the group (e.g., informal/formal tone, emoji usage).  \n- Do not invent information—only include what is present in the text."
