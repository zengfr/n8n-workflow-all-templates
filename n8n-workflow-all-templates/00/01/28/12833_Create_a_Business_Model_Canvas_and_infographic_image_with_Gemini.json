Based on the user's answers regarding their business idea, your task is to organize and create the 9 elements of the Business Model Canvas.\n\n## Step 1: Validation (REQUIRED)\n\nBefore generating the Business Model Canvas, you MUST validate the user's answers:\n\n### Validation Criteria\n1. **Relevance Check**: Answers must be related to business/service concepts\n2. **Completeness Check**: Key questions (Customer, Value Proposition, Revenue) must have meaningful answers\n3. **Coherence Check**: Answers should be logically consistent with each other\n\n### Invalid Answer Examples\n- Random text, gibberish, or test data (e.g., \"asdf\", \"test\", \"xxx\")\n- Completely unrelated content (e.g., recipes, song lyrics, jokes)\n- Contradictory information that cannot form a coherent business model\n- Answers that are too vague to extract any business insight (e.g., \"something\", \"anything\")\n\n### Validation Result\n\nIf answers are INVALID, respond ONLY with this JSON format and nothing else:\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"ERROR\",\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of what was wrong\",\n  \"message\": \"We were unable to create a Business Model Canvas from your responses. Please provide specific information about your business idea and try again.\"\n}\n```\n\nIf answers are VALID, proceed to Step 2.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Generate Business Model Canvas\n\nOnly proceed here if validation passed.\n\n### Rules for Elaboration\nDo not simply transcribe the user's answers. Instead, slightly flesh out the content based on the following perspectives:\n\n1. **Concretize**:\n   - If there are vague expressions, infer from the context and add specific details.\n   - *Example:* Change \"SNS\" to specific platforms like \"Instagram\" or \"X\" based on the target audience.\n\n2. **Complement**:\n   - Add elements that are clearly necessary from the context, even if not explicitly stated in the answers.\n   - *Example:* Organize Channels into the flow of \"Awareness -> Purchase -> Delivery\".\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - Do not interpret in a way that deviates from the user's intent.\n   - Do not over-expand the content (keep additions light and relevant).\n   - If you add parts based on speculation, mark them as \"(Assumed)\" if necessary.\n\n### Output Format\n\nExtract and organize the information into the following 9 elements:\n\n**【Customer Segments (CS)】**\n* Who are we creating value for?\n\n**【Value Propositions (VP)】**\n* What problems are we solving? What value do we deliver to the customer?\n\n**【Channels (CH)】**\n* How do we reach the customer? (Organize by Awareness -> Purchase -> Delivery)\n\n**【Customer Relationships (CR)】**\n* What type of relationship do we establish with the customer?\n\n**【Revenue Streams (RS)】**\n* How does the business generate income?\n\n**【Key Resources (KR)】**\n* What key assets are required? (Skills, qualifications, equipment, etc.)\n\n**【Key Activities (KA)】**\n* What key activities are necessary to deliver the Value Propositions?\n\n**【Key Partners (KP)】**\n* Who are the external partners or suppliers?\n\n**【Cost Structure (CS)】**\n* What are the major costs involved? (Fixed costs, variable costs, initial investment)"
