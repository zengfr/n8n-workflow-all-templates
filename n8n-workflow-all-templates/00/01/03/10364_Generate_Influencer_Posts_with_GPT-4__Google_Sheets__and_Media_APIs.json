Paste your **Google Sheet ID** into the Google Sheets nodes.  \n2. Add your **API keys or URLs** inside the HTTP Request and AI nodes.  \n3. Click **Execute Workflow** (or trigger via form).  \n4. Check your Google Sheet for the generated post ideas and media links.\n\n---\n\n### **Requirements**\n- OpenAI (or compatible LLM) API key  \n- Image / Video generation API (KIE, Repanda, etc.)  \n- Google Sheets credentials  \n\n---\n\n### **Notes**\nAI output is for **creative inspiration only** — always review and refine before publishing.  \nIf your API or Sheet ID changes, update them directly in the relevant nodes."
