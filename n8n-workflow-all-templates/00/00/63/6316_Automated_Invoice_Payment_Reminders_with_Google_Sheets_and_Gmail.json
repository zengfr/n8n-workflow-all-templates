        "content": "# Workflow Documentation: Automated Invoice Reminder\n\n## Problem 😩\nBusinesses often struggle with delayed payments due to outstanding invoices. Manually tracking due dates and sending timely reminders is a repetitive, time-consuming task that can lead to:\n* **Cash flow issues:** Funds are tied up in unpaid invoices.\n* **Lost time:** Staff spend hours on manual accounts receivable.\n* **Missed opportunities:** Focus shifts from growth to debt collection.\n* **Awkward client interactions:** Late reminders can feel less professional.\n\n## Solution ✨\nThis n8n workflow automates the crucial process of sending invoice reminders. It periodically checks your invoice data and automatically dispatches personalized email reminders to clients whose invoices are either:\n* **Due soon:** Reminding them before the due date.\n* **Overdue:** Prompting for payment if the due date has passed.\n\nThis ensures timely payments, improves cash flow, and frees up your team to focus on core business activities.\n\n## For Who 🤝\nThis workflow is perfect for:\n* **Freelancers & Consultants:** To ensure timely payment for services.\n* **Small & Medium Businesses (SMBs):** To automate accounts receivable and improve cash flow.\n* **Agencies:** To streamline billing processes and reduce administrative burden.\n* **Anyone** who manages invoices and wants to simplify payment collection.\n\n## Scope 🎯\n* **Input Data:** Invoice details (e.g., InvoiceID, ClientName, ClientEmail, Amount, DueDate, Status) from a Google Sheet.\n* **Trigger:** Daily scheduled check.\n* **Logic:** Filters invoices due within a configurable window (e.g., 3 days before and 7 days after the due date) and skips already paid invoices.\n* **Output:** Personalized email reminders sent via Gmail (or another email service).\n* **Customization:** Easily adaptable to different email templates and reminder logic.\n\n## How It Works ⚙️\n\nThis workflow systematically ensures you never miss sending an invoice reminder:\n\n1.  **Daily Schedule Trigger:** ⏰ The workflow starts automatically at a set time each day (e.g., every morning). This ensures continuous monitoring of your invoice statuses.\n2.  **Read Invoice Data (Google Sheets):** 📊 The workflow connects to your specified Google Sheet to retrieve a list of all your invoices and their details. **Ensure your sheet has required columns like `InvoiceID`, `ClientName`, `ClientEmail`, `Amount`, `DueDate`, and `Status`.**\n3.  **Filter & Prepare Reminders (Function):** 🧹 This is the core logic. It processes each invoice row:\n    * Compares the `DueDate` with the current date.\n    * Identifies invoices that are due soon (e.g., within 3 days) or are already overdue (e.g., up to 7 days past due).\n    * Skips invoices marked as 'Paid'.\n    * Prepares a custom subject line and email body for each relevant reminder.\n4.  **If Invoices to Remind?:** 🚦 This node acts as a gate. If the previous step found any invoices needing reminders, the workflow proceeds. If not, it stops gracefully.\n5.  **Send Invoice Reminder (Gmail):** 📧 For each filtered invoice, this node sends a personalized email reminder to the client. The email uses the dynamic subject and body prepared in the 'Filter & Prepare Reminders' step.\n\n## How to Set Up 🛠️\n\nFollow these steps carefully to get your \"Automated Invoice Reminder\" workflow up and running:\n\n1.  **Import Workflow JSON:**\n    * Open your n8n instance.\n    * Click on 'Workflows' in the left sidebar.\n    * Click the '+' button or 'New' to create a new workflow.\n    * Click the '...' (More Options) icon in the top right.\n    * Select 'Import from JSON' and paste this entire JSON code (from the previous response).\n\n2.  **Configure Daily Schedule Trigger:**\n    * Locate the 'Daily Schedule Trigger' node (1. Daily Schedule Trigger).\n    * **Adjust 'interval', 'value', and 'timezone'** to your preferred daily reminder time (e.g., every 24 hours at 9 AM in your local timezone).\n\n3.  **Configure Read Invoice Data (Google Sheets):**\n    * Locate the 'Read Invoice Data (Google Sheets)' node (2. Read Invoice Data).\n    * **Credentials:** Select your existing Google Sheets OAuth2 credential or click 'Create New' to set one up. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIAL_ID` with the actual ID or name of your credential.\n    * **Sheet ID:** Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` with the actual ID of your Google Sheet where invoice data is stored.\n    * **Range:** Ensure the 'range' (e.g., `Invoices!A:F`) correctly covers all your invoice data. **Crucially, ensure your Google Sheet has columns with exact names: `InvoiceID`, `ClientName`, `ClientEmail`, `Amount`, `DueDate` (in a parsable date format like YYYY-MM-DD), and `Status` (e.g., 'Pending', 'Paid').**\n\n4.  **Configure Filter & Prepare Reminders (Function):**\n    * Locate the 'Filter & Prepare Reminders' node (3. Filter & Prepare Reminders).\n    * **Date & Field Names:** Review the `functionCode`. **Adjust the variable names (e.g., `invoice.InvoiceID`, `invoice.DueDate`)** if your Google Sheet uses different column headers.\n    * **Reminder Window:** You can modify `remindBeforeDays` and `remindAfterDays` to adjust how many days before/after the due date reminders are sent.\n    * **Email Content:** Modify the `subjectPrefix` and `bodyText` within the code to customize the reminder message for 'due soon' and 'overdue' invoices.\n\n5.  **Configure Send Invoice Reminder (Gmail):**\n    * Locate the 'Send Invoice Reminder (Gmail)' node (5. Send Invoice Reminder).\n    * **Credentials:** Select your existing Gmail OAuth2 credential or click 'Create New'. Replace `YOUR_GMAIL_CREDENTIAL_ID` with the actual ID or name of your credential.\n    * **From Email:** Replace `YOUR_SENDER_EMAIL@example.com` with the email address you want the reminders to be sent from.\n    * **Email Content:** The 'subject' and 'html' fields are dynamically generated by the previous 'Function' node (`={{ $json.subject }}` and `={{ $json.body }}`). You can further customize the HTML email template here if needed.\n\n6.  **Review and Activate:**\n    * Thoroughly review all node configurations. Ensure all placeholder values (like `YOUR_...`) are replaced and settings are correct.\n    * Click the 'Save' button in the top right corner.\n    * Finally, toggle the 'Inactive' switch to 'Active' to enable your workflow. 🟢 Your automated invoice reminder is now live and ready to improve your cash flow!\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:** 💡\n* **Execution History:** Always check the 'Executions' tab in n8n for detailed error messages if the workflow fails.\n* **Google Sheet Data:** Ensure your Google Sheet data is clean and matches the expected column headers and date formats.\n* **Function Node Logic:** If invoices aren't being filtered correctly, the `Function` node is the place to debug. Use the 'Test Workflow' feature to inspect the data flowing into and out of this node.\n* **Credential Issues:** Double-check that all credentials are correctly set up and active in n8n."
