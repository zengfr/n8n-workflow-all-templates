Below is the format of how you should output your information. You should use google shopping on google search (SERPAPI) tool to obtain the most relevant and accurate information.\n \nName of company/tool\nPrice: Provide if it is a one time purchase, monthly subscription and if there is a free version.\nLimits: Provide any limitations on completing the desired tasks. Is there a limit on the number of tasks that can be completed? Does it only work with certain software?\nSummary of reviews: You should provide an overall summary of the reviews, how many reviews, as well as the star rating of each item. Go in depth on the summary of the reviews. Provide 3-4 pros and 2-3 cons of each item. \nConclusion:\n\n\n\n#additional information \n\n\nBelow is an example of how you should provide responses.\n\nConstant Contact\nPrice\n-Subscription-based only—no one‑time purchase or permanent free plan.\n-14‑day free trial available.\n-Plans begin at $12/month (Lite), then $35/month (Standard), and $80/month (Premium). \n\nLimits\n-Automation capabilities are basic: welcome emails, anniversary or birthday triggers, abandoned cart reminders (via Shopify/WooCommerce), and simple single‑trigger workflows.\n-Deeper automation (multi-step, advanced triggers, conditional logic) requires the Premium plan and is still less flexible than many competitors.\n-Templates and design editors offer limited customization—image swapping and background choices are constrained.\n-Supports up to unlimited lists but segmentation is limited unless on higher tiers and granular “if–then” logic is absent at lower levels.\n-Autoresponder only sends from your “From” address and does not capture replies within the platform.\n-Sends may have limits and overage fees; no unlimited sends plan. \n\nSummary of Reviews\n\n-Email Tool Tester (1.3 years ago)\n--Star rating not numeric; overall negative on automation.\n--Pros: Good deliverability; useful AI content drafting; supports basic automated campaigns like abandoned carts.\n--Cons: Poor price‑performance; limited automation; segmentation only on higher plans; challenging cancellation.\n\n-Moosend / MailerLite blog (~recent)\n--Pros: High deliverability (~92%); intuitive interface; multi‑channel features; extensive integrations (5,500–7,800 apps); good analytics.\n--Cons: Expensive at scale; automations limited; dated template designs; segmentation and testing capabilities minimal \nMailerLite.\n\n-G2 (various recent reviews)\n--High-end rating: average 4–5/5 on ease‑of‑use; automation rated well for simplicity but weaker on customization.\n--Review sample:\n--DeAnn B (5/5): praise for automation ease and organized segmented campaigns; minor template image issues.\n--Jerome T (3.5/5): automation user‑friendly, but less powerful than ActiveCampaign/Klaviyo.\n--Pros: Ease of use; time‑saving; good for weekly campaign sending; content creation tools; segmentation.\n--Cons: Missing advanced features; limited template customization; sequence edits require rebuild; editing glitches. \n\n-Business.com and Capterra (3–9 months ago)\n--Business.com rating 9.4/10: highlights autocomplete, autoresponders, deliverability, and editor; cons include no free plan, limited A/B testing, and no unlimited sends. \n--Capterra (Oct 2024): 5/5 overall; pro: ease‑of‑use, automation features; con: pricing high for small lists.\n\n-Reddit feedback\n--Mixed community opinions:\n--“Constant Contact is simply a bad product… way better deliverability, and amazing analytics [elsewhere]”. \n--“Takes FOREVER… crashes nonstop… HOGS my CPU”.\n--Also reports of “difficult cancellation” and aggressive upselling.\n\nOverall Rating\nBased on ~hundreds of reviews across platforms:\nAverage score: ~4/5—strong in usability and basic automation but weak in depth, customization, and price value.\n\nPros (3–4)\n-Easy to use and set up, especially for beginners. G2 notes intuitive campaign templates, drag-and-drop email creation. \n-Reliable deliverability (~92–97%) with built-in authentication tools \n-Time-saving email automation, including welcome sequences, anniversaries, abandoned carts, and non-opener resends. \n-Extensive integrations (5K–7K+ apps), including CRM, e‑commerce, social channels, event ticketing.\n\nCons (2–3)\n-Automation is basic—limited to single triggers, simple workflows; lacks conditional logic and advanced paths. \n-High cost for features—value diminishes rapidly with contacts list growth; extras (SMS, segmentation, A/B testing) only on higher tiers. \n-Design and editing limitations—template customization is rigid; editor can be glitchy; sequence adjustments may require rebuilding. \n\nConclusion\nConstant Contact is a solid choice for small businesses seeking easy-to-use, reliable email automation and deliverability with good integration options. However, if you need advanced, flexible automation, granular personalization, or modern design freedom—and want maximum value—it may fall short. Based on user feedback, it's best suited for basic autoresponder needs, not complex multistep campaigns.\n\n\n"

G2 notes intuitive campaign templates, drag-and-drop email creation. \n-Reliable deliverability (~92–97%) with built-in authentication tools \n-Time-saving email automation, including welcome sequences, anniversaries, abandoned carts, and non-opener resends. \n-Extensive integrations (5K–7K+ apps), including CRM, e‑commerce, social channels, event ticketing.\n\nCons (2–3)\n-Automation is basic—limited to single triggers, simple workflows; lacks conditional logic and advanced paths. \n-High cost for features—value diminishes rapidly with contacts list growth; extras (SMS, segmentation, A/B testing) only on higher tiers. \n-Design and editing limitations—template customization is rigid; editor can be glitchy; sequence adjustments may require rebuilding. \n\nConclusion\nConstant Contact is a solid choice for small businesses seeking easy-to-use, reliable email automation and deliverability with good integration options. However, if you need advanced, flexible automation, granular personalization, or modern design freedom—and want maximum value—it may fall short.
