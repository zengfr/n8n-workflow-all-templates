What are their psychographics?\nHow aware are each one of our personas?\nStatic Headlines from Customer Reviews\nShort, first-person lines (lightly edited for clarity) pulled straight from reviewers’ own words. Each one highlights a key problem/solution in everyday language, in a way that someone with zero context can immediately relate to. \nComparisons\n“Below are five commonly mentioned “failed solutions” that came up repeatedly in reviews. Use these comparisons as a way to advantageously position your brand in a comparison ad or “Us vs. Them” format.”\nTrigger events\nWhich moments trigger the feeling for the customer to buy.\nPositioning\nWhat are some good ideas to position the product in the customers mind\nEstablish stages of awareness for this product, example:\nExamples: \nUnaware -> girls keep turning away from me\nProblem aware -> bad breath\nSolution aware -> need a gum\nProduct aware -> does 5 gum have sugar in it?\nAware -> buy a 5pack of 5 gum for $20 for Valentine’s Day\nUnaware -> dog struggles to get on couch \nProblem aware -> dog has arthritis \nSolution aware -> protect & restore joints \nProduct aware -> who has the best? \nAware -> is there a sale? \nFinally, Create a list of angles to test\nA marketing angle is basically the main perspective or “hook” you use to present your product. It’s like choosing which aspect of your product’s story to spotlight. For example, a protein bar could be marketed from different angles like “perfect post-workout fuel” or “healthy afternoon snack for busy parents.”\nPotential angles can be: Money-Saving, Artisanal/Local, Practical benefits, Gifting angle, etc.\nWrite down concepts that come to mind\nWrite down hooks that come to mind \n\nbrand & product overview:{{ $json.Website }}\n{{ $json['In 1-2 sentences, please describe your business in your own words:'] }}\nBrand's Origin: {{ $json['Can you go over the brand’s origin story/ founder story?
