        "content": "# 🕵️ Simple Log Anomaly Detector 🧠\n\n* **Problem Solved:**\n    Detecting cyberattacks like brute-force or unauthorized login attempts early is crucial. However, the manual process of sifting through system logs to find suspicious patterns—such as \"repeated failed logins\" or \"access from unusual locations\"—is a tedious, time-consuming, and often ineffective task. These anomalous patterns can easily be missed, giving attackers a window to operate undetected.\n\n* **Solution Overview:**\n    This n8n workflow provides a powerful yet concise solution with **basic SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) functionality**. It periodically pulls logs from a specified source, processes the data, and **looks for unusual patterns, such as a high volume of failed login attempts in a short period**. If this suspicious activity exceeds a set threshold, the workflow sends a **detailed alert to Slack**. This gives your team proactive, early detection of potential threats without the burden of manual log review.\n\n* **For Whom:**\n    This automation is ideal for:\n    * **IT Teams and SysAdmins:** To monitor logs for anomalies on servers and applications.\n    * **Security Specialists:** As a simple, effective early-warning tool for common attacks.\n    * **DevOps Teams:** To track unusual activity in staging or production environments.\n    * **Any Business (especially SMEs):** That manages its own servers and needs an effective way to enhance security without a large investment in SIEM tools.\n\n### Scope\n* **What it does:**\n    * Runs on a customizable schedule (e.g., every 15 minutes).\n    * Pulls log data from a specified external source via an API endpoint.\n    * Processes the log data to filter and count specific events (e.g., login failures).\n    * Checks if the count of these events exceeds a predefined threshold.\n    * Sends a detailed alert to a Slack channel if the threshold is breached.\n* **What it doesn't do:**\n    * This workflow **does not perform a comprehensive security analysis** of all log events. It is focused on a single, user-defined pattern (e.g., failed logins).\n    * It does not automatically block malicious IPs or take any other remediation actions. It is a detection and alerting tool only.\n    * It does not store historical log data for long-term analysis.\n\n### How It Works: The 5-Node Anomaly Detection Flow\n\nThis workflow efficiently processes logs to detect anomalies.\n\n1.  **Scheduled Check (Cron Node):**\n    * **Function:** This is the primary trigger. It schedules the workflow to run at a defined interval (e.g., every 15 minutes).\n    * **Process:** The `Cron` node automatically starts the workflow on its schedule, ensuring logs are routinely scanned for suspicious activity.\n\n2.  **Fetch Logs (HTTP Request Node):**\n    * **Function:** This node is responsible for retrieving logs from an external source.\n    * **Process:** It sends a request to your log API endpoint to get a batch of the most recent logs.\n\n3.  **Count Failed Logins (Code Node):**\n    * **Function:** This is the core of the detection logic. It processes the raw log data.\n    * **Process:** The JavaScript code filters the logs for a specific event (`\"login_failure\"`), counts the total, and identifies unique IPs involved. This information is then passed to the next node.\n\n4.  **Failed Logins > Threshold? (If Node):**\n    * **Function:** This node serves as the final filter. It checks if the total count of failed logins exceeds a threshold you set (e.g., more than 5 attempts).\n    * **Process:** If the count is greater than the threshold, the workflow is routed to the notification node. If not, the workflow ends safely.\n\n5.  **Send Anomaly Alert (Slack Node):**\n    * **Function:** This node sends an alert to your team if an anomaly is detected.\n    * **Process:** The alert sent to Slack includes a summary of the anomaly, such as the number of failed attempts and the IPs involved, enabling a swift response."
