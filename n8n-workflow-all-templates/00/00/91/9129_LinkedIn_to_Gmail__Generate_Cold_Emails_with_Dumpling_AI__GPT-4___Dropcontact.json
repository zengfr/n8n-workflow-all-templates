Adding to this, a couple of months ago we were also recognized again by TIME Magazine & Statista, for the second time.\n\nWe’ve asked our EVP France Operations, Laurent Bataille : “What does it take to become the world’s most sustainable company?” For him, sustainability is a long-term adventure.\n\nFor more than 20 years, sustainability has guided our choices and shaped our strategy. “I think that behind this success lies a cultural aspect,” says Laurent. At Schneider Electric we have a real understanding of the effect we have on our ecosystems and stakeholders. “We are both a solution provider and diligent in-house practitioner,” he adds.\n\nDigitalization, AI, climate change, energy transition, the evolution of global wealth and balance… these are our next frontiers.
