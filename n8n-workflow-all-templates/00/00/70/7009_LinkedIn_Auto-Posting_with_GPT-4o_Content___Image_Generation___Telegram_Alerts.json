Here's the story: • 2009: Redis launched as open-source (BSD license). • 2018: Redis Labs introduced RSAL for modules like Redis Search, Graph etc. • 2024: Redis switched to a commercial license, as cloud providers copied Redis code without contributing back. • 2025: Redis is open source again with AGPL v3. But why? Big players like AWS, Google, and Oracle backed the Valkey fork—a fully open-source Redis alternative now under the Linux Foundation. Check out Valkey—\",\n  \"10x Faster Typescript COMPILER!!! Still there is an ongoing debate on why Microsoft didn't choose Rust or their own C# for this rewrite. Although, according to the team, Go was a better choice as it provided a similar structure and seamless transition. Had it been a ground-up rewrite and not a migration, Rust or C# would have been a better choice.\",\n  \"I recently started working on a Teams to Signal messenger bot after realizing that so many people outright hate using MS Teams, but since it's an industry standard, they cannot directly ditch it. My current goal is to support forwarding incoming text messages on Teams to a messenger like Signal. The second will be to give support for the reply mechanism from Signal and sync it to Teams. Coming to the technical stuff, I am thinking of using automation tools like Cypress or Playwright to do this. But it all boils down to the availability of public APIs of both messengers. I will try to document my progress here, as I might fail trying, like a lot of other times 😅 Let's see how it pans out. How would you approach this kind of problem?\",\n    \"Do you know about the require cache in Node.js? Lets say you have a js module that you have imported in a js file using require statement. It is highly possible that after a few iterations to your module code, the changes wont reflect even after you have reloaded the api server/modules. This happens because there is a module cache that happens. You need to invalidate it in order for the new changes to reflect. More on this here -\",\n    \"How important is Out-of-Box experience for an open source contributor? Nowadays I have been working on creating a seamless out-of-box experience for the new contributors of Sparrow API Tool. A poor app setup experience or hard-to-understand README file can be a serious dealbreaker for the community. I am emphasizing on the following things to make the setup as smooth as possible: 1) Created and hosted Docker images for various microservices like api-service and auth-service on DockerHub. 2) Created an all-in-one docker-compose file to set up everything from database to queue service in one command. 3) Created a migration script that generates a test user on app start—bypassing auth flow for instant contribution. 4) Documented multiple setup methods (Docker and non-Docker). 5) Pre-filled example .env files with required variables for copy-paste convenience. Let me know if you have suggestions to improve this further—I’m open to feedback!\"\n]\n}\n",
