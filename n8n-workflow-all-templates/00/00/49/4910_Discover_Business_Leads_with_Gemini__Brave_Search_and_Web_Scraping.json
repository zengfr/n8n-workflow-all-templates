It receives criteria (business type, location, etc.), uses its LLM (`Google Gemini Chat Model`) and a suite of search tools (`brave_web_search`, `google_gemini_business_search`, and very selectively `brave_local_search`, `jina_ai_web_page_scraper`) to identify a list of businesses, and then formats this list as a structured JSON output.\n*   **How it works internally:** The `prospect_discovery_agent` node orchestrates tool calls based on its system prompt and the input criteria. Its primary goal is to generate a list of relevant business names and websites, not deep profiles.\n*   **Why this pattern is useful:**\n    1.  **Modularity & Specialization:** Complex tasks (like broad prospect discovery vs. specific business lookup) are broken down into specialized agents, making each agent simpler and more effective at its specific job.\n    2.  **Reusability:** This Prospect Discovery agent could potentially be called by other workflows in the future that need to identify types of businesses.\n    3.  **Clarity:** Separating discovery logic from detailed research logic keeps each workflow cleaner."

This n8n workflow acts as a specialized intelligent assistant that, given a business type and location, uses multiple search strategies to identify a list of potential prospect companies and their websites.\n\nStop manually trawling through search results! This agent automates the initial phase of lead generation by:\n*   Understanding your target business profile (type, location, keywords).\n*   Strategically using web search tools (Brave Search, Google Gemini Search) to find relevant businesses.\n*   Performing quick validations to confirm relevance.\n*   Returning a clean, structured JSON list of prospect names and their website URLs.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\nThe workflow is built around an AI agent powered by Google Gemini. This agent is equipped with tools like:\n\n*   **Brave Web Search:** For broad initial sourcing of potential business candidates.\n*   **Google Gemini Search:** For advanced, context-aware discovery and finding businesses mentioned in various online sources.\n*   **Brave Local Search (Selective):** For quick verification of local presence or finding website URLs for identified names.\n*   **Jina AI Web Page Scraper (Very Selective):** For extremely rapid relevance checks on uncertain websites by scanning page content for keywords.\n\nThe agent's system prompt guides it to use these tools efficiently to build a list of prospects without getting bogged down in deep research on any single one at this discovery stage.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\n*   **Lead Generation:** Automatically generate lists of potential clients based on industry and location.\n*   **Market Research:** Identify key players or types of businesses in a specific geographical area.\n*   **Sales Development:** Provide SDRs with initial lists of companies to research further.\n*   **Called as a Sub-Workflow:** Designed to be easily integrated as a \"tool\" into more complex orchestrating AI agents (e.g., a BNI Pitch Planner that first needs to identify who to target).\n\n**Setup:**\n\n1.  **Import the workflow.**\n2.  **Configure Credentials:** You'll need n8n credentials for:\n    *   Google Gemini (for the Chat model and the Gemini Search/Vertex AI Search tool).\n    *   Brave Search (e.g., via Smithery MCP, or adapt if you have direct API access).\n    *   Jina AI (for the web scraper).\n    Assign these to the respective nodes.\n3.  **Review System Prompt:** The `prospect_discovery_agent` node contains a detailed system prompt. You can fine-tune this to adjust its search strategies or the strictness of its matching.\n4.  **Inputs:** This workflow is triggered by an \"Execute Workflow Trigger\" node (`prospect_discovery_workflow`). It expects the following inputs:\n    *   `business_type` (string): e.g., \"artisan bakery\"\n    *   `location_query` (string): e.g., \"Portland, Oregon\"\n    *   `desired_num_prospects` (number): e.g., 5\n    *   `additional_keywords` (string, optional): e.g., \"organic, gluten-free\"\n\n**To Use (as a Sub-Workflow/Tool):**\n\nThis workflow is typically called by another n8n workflow (e.g., using a \"Tool Workflow\" node from the Langchain nodes). The calling workflow would provide the inputs listed above. The \"Prospect Discovery\" workflow will then execute and its final node (the `prospect_discovery_agent`) will output a JSON array of found prospects, like:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"business_name\": \"Rose Petal Bakery\",\n    \"website_url\": \"https://rosepetalbakerypdx.com\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"business_name\": \"The Daily Bread Artisans\",\n    \"website_url\": \"https://dailybreadpdx.com\"\n  }\n]\n```\nIf no prospects are found, it returns an empty array `[]`.\n\nThis template provides a powerful and focused tool for automating the initial stages of prospect identification."

This process is guided by the `business_type`, `location_query`, `desired_num_prospects`, and optional `additional_keywords` you receive. Your final output must be a structured JSON array of these detailed prospect profiles.\n\n**Inputs You Will Receive:**\n*   `business_type`: (string) The category or type of business to search for (e.g., \"crane hire company\", \"artisan bakery\").\n*   `location_query`: (string) A description of the target geographical area (e.g., \"Newcastle NSW Australia\", \"downtown San Francisco\"). This is crucial.\n*   `desired_num_prospects`: (number) The target number of unique, well-profiled prospects.\n*   `additional_keywords`: (string, optional) Other terms to refine the search.\n\n**Your Operational Protocol:**\n\n**Phase 1: Initial Prospect Candidate Identification**\n1.  **Formulate Broad Search Queries:** Combine `business_type`, `location_query`, and `additional_keywords`. Examples: \"list of `[business_type]` in `[location_query]` `[additional_keywords]`\", \"top `[business_type]` `[location_query]`\".\n2.  **Use Search Tools for Candidate List:**\n    *   Primarily use `brave_web_search` (e.g., with `count: 10` or `15`) and/or `google_gemini_prospect_finder` for these broad queries.\n    *   **Goal:** From search result snippets and titles, extract a working list of potential company names and their website URLs. Aim for slightly more candidates than `desired_num_prospects` initially (e.g., if targeting 3, find 5-7).\n\n**Phase 2: Detailed Profiling of Selected Candidates**\nIterate through your initial list of candidates. For each candidate, attempt to build a detailed profile until you have successfully profiled up to `desired_num_prospects` businesses.\n\nFor each candidate business from Phase 1:\n1.  **Confirm Official Name & Primary Website URL:**\n    *   If not perfectly clear, use a targeted `brave_web_search` (e.g., `{\"query\": \"[Candidate Company Name from initial list] official website\"}`) or `brave_local_search` (e.g., `{\"query\": \"[Candidate Company Name from initial list] [location_query]\"}`).\n    *   If a clear official website cannot be confidently found, consider skipping this candidate for detailed profiling.\n\n2.  **Gather Key Business Details (once website is confirmed):**\n    *   **Website Content Analysis (`jina_ai_web_page_scraper`):**\n        *   **Tool Input:** `{\"url\": \"[Prospect's Confirmed Website URL]\"}`. Prioritize scraping 'About Us', 'Contact Us', or 'Services' pages if their URLs are identifiable or inferable. If not, scrape the homepage.\n        *   **Information to Extract:** A brief description of their services/business focus; contact phone numbers; general email addresses (like info@, sales@); names of owners, founders, or key management.\n        *   **Usage Note:** Be judicious. If a site is very large, focus on 1-2 key pages.\n    *   **Targeted Information Search (using `google_gemini_prospect_finder` or `brave_local_search`):**\n        *   **Tool Inputs:** Formulate precise queries.\n            *   `google_gemini_prospect_finder`: e.g., `{\"query\": \"owner of [Prospect Name]\"}` or `{\"query\": \"contact phone [Prospect Name] [location_query]\"}`. If a key person's name is found from scraping: `{\"query\": \"[Key Person Name] [Prospect Name] LinkedIn\"}`.\n            *   `brave_local_search`: e.g., `{\"query\": \"[Prospect Name] [location_query]\"}` (can yield listed phone, address).\n        *   **Goal:** Find/confirm phone numbers, identify contact persons, and verify service descriptions.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Construct Profile for Current Prospect:**\n    *   Compile all verified information for the current prospect.\n    *   If essential details (e.g., a verifiable phone number or a clear description of services that matches the `business_type`) cannot be found after reasonable attempts, you may discard this candidate and move to the next from your initial list. Aim for quality profiles.\n\n**Phase 3: Final Output Generation**\n1.  **Format as JSON Array:** Your final output MUST be a JSON array containing one object for each successfully profiled prospect.\n    ```json\n    [\n      {\n        \"business_name\": \"Example Crane Hire Pty Ltd\",\n        \"website_url\": \"https://www.examplecrane.com.au\",\n        \"description\": \"Provides crane rental and lifting services for construction projects in Newcastle.\",\n        \"key_contact_owner\": \"John Smith (Owner/Operator)\", // Or \"Contact: Operations Manager\", or \"N/A\" if not found\n        \"phone_number\": \"02-1234-5678\", // Or \"N/A\" if not found\n        \"contact_email\": \"info@examplecrane.com.au\", // Or \"N/A\" if not found\n        \"linkedin_profile\": \"https://linkedin.com/in/johnsmithcrane\" // Or \"N/A\" if not found\n      }\n      // ... up to desired_num_prospects objects\n    ]\n    ```\n2.  **Return ONLY the JSON Array:** No introductory text, no \"Here is the list:\", just the array itself.\n3.  **Empty Array for No Valid Results:** If no prospects can be adequately profiled up to `desired_num_prospects`, return an empty array: `[]`.\n\n**Critical: Tool Input Precision:**\n*   When preparing to call ANY tool (`brave_web_search`, `google_gemini_prospect_finder`, `brave_local_search`, `jina_ai_web_page_scraper`), the JSON input you generate for that tool MUST strictly match its expected schema.\n    *   `brave_web_search`: Expects `{\"query\": \"string\", \"count\": number (optional), \"offset\": number (optional)}`.\n    *   `google_gemini_prospect_finder`: Expects `{\"query\": \"string\", \"organization\": \"string (optional)\", \"restrictUrls\": \"string (optional)\"}`.\n    *   `brave_local_search`: Expects `{\"query\": \"string\", \"count\": number (optional)}`.\n    *   `jina_ai_web_page_scraper`: Expects `{\"url\": \"string\"}`.\n*   **Always ensure all required parameters for a tool are present in your generated input, and that data types are correct (strings are quoted, numbers are not).** Mistakes here will cause schema errors.\n\n**Priorities:**\n*   **Actionable Contact Details:** For each profiled prospect, strive to find a business phone number. A key contact/owner is highly desirable.\n*   **Relevance:** Profiled businesses must genuinely match the `business_type` in the `location_query`.\n*   **Accuracy:** Verify information where possible. If a detail is uncertain or cannot be found, use \"N/A\" or a similar indicator in the output JSON."
