It is especially useful for organizations handling large volumes of applications and seeking to streamline their recruitment process.\n\nThis workflow automates the resume screening process using OpenAI for analysis and Supabase for structured data storage. It provides a matching score, a summary of candidate suitability, and key insights into why the candidate fits (or doesn’t fit) the job. \n\n1. **Retrieve Resume**: The workflow downloads CVs from a direct link (e.g., Supabase storage or Dropbox).\n2. **Extract Data**: Extracts text data from PDF or DOC files for analysis.\n3. **Analyze with OpenAI**: Sends the extracted data and job description to OpenAI to:\n   - Generate a matching score.\n   - Summarize candidate strengths and weaknesses.\n   - Provide actionable insights into their suitability for the job.\n4. **Store Results in Supabase**: Saves the analysis and raw data in a structured format for further processing or integration into other tools.\n"
