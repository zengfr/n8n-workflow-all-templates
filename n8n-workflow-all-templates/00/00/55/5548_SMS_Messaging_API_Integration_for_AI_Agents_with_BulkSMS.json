All requests require `Content-Type: application/json` and support features like Unicode encoding, group messaging, and batch sends. Dates must be ISO-8601 formatted, and unknown response properties should be ignored for forward compatibility.\n\n### 🔧 How it Works\n\nThis workflow converts the BulkSMS JSON REST API into an MCP-compatible interface for AI agents.\n\n• **MCP Trigger**: Serves as your server endpoint for AI agent requests\n• **HTTP Request Nodes**: Handle API calls to https://api.bulksms.com/v1\n• **AI Expressions**: Automatically populate parameters via `$fromAI()` placeholders\n• **Native Integration**: Returns responses directly to the AI agent\n\n\n### 📋 Available Operations (15 endpoints)\n\n**Blocked Numbers (2 operations)**\nList Blocked Numbers, Block Phone Number\n\n**Credits (1 operations)**\nTransfer Account Credits\n\n**Message (5 operations)**\nRetrieve Message History, Send New Message, Send Quick Message, View Message Details, List Related Messages\n\n**Profile (1 operations)**\nRetrieve User Profile\n\n**Attachments (1 operations)**\nGenerate Attachment Upload URL\n\n**Web Hooks (5 operations)**\nList All Webhooks, Register New Webhook, Remove Webhook, Get Webhook Details, Update Webhook Settings\n\n"
