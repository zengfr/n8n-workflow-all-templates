This score will determine the next step in the sales process (e.g., sending a calendar link, starting a chat, or sending a follow-up email).\n</goal>\n\n<context>\nYou will be given four pieces of information from a lead, corresponding to the BANT framework.\n\n**BANT Criteria Mapping:**\n- **Budget:** The answer to \"what's your budget\".\n- **Authority:** The answer to \"what's your current position / job ?\".\n- **Need:** The answer to \"what do you want to build in n8n ?\".\n- **Timing:** The answer to \"when do you want to start ?\".\n\n**Scoring Logic:**\nYou must first evaluate each of the four BANT components individually as 'hot', 'mid', or 'cold' based on the following criteria:\n\n- **Budget:**\n    - **Hot:** Specific, significant budget mentioned (e.g., >$5,000, 'we have a budget allocated', 'funded project').\n    - **Mid:** Vague but positive budget (e.g., '$1,000-$5,000', 'flexible', 'depends on scope').\n    - **Cold:** No budget, very low budget, or just exploring (e.g., 'no budget', 'I'm a student', 'just looking', 'undecided').\n\n- **Authority:**\n    - **Hot:** Clear decision-maker or C-level role (e.g., CEO, Founder, CTO, Head of, Director, Owner, Project Manager).\n    - **Mid:** Influencer or team member (e.g., Developer, Analyst, Specialist, Engineer).\n    - **Cold:** No clear business authority (e.g., Student, Intern, Hobbyist, Unemployed, 'Just learning').\n\n- **Need:**\n    - **Hot:** Specific, urgent, business-critical problem described (e.g., 'Automate our client onboarding process', 'Integrate our CRM with our billing system to save 10 hours a week').\n    - **Mid:** General business goal (e.g., 'Improve our marketing workflows', 'Connect some apps', 'build an internal tool').\n    - **Cold:** Vague, personal, or for learning purposes (e.g., 'Just playing around', 'A personal project', 'I don't know yet', 'testing').\n\n- **Timing:**\n    - **Hot:** Immediate timeline (e.g., 'ASAP', 'This week', 'Within the month', 'Immediately').\n    - **Mid:** Near-term timeline (e.g., 'Next quarter', 'In 1-3 months').\n    - **Cold:** Long-term or no timeline (e.g., 'In 6+ months', 'No timeline yet', 'Just researching').\n\n**Overall Classification Rules:**\nAfter evaluating each component, use the following rules to determine the final score:\n- **Hot:** The lead must have at least 3 'hot' indicators and **no** 'cold' indicators.\n- **Cold:** The lead has 2 or more 'cold' indicators.\n- **Mid:** Any other combination.\n</context>\n\n<examples>\n<example_1>\n<inputs>\n<need>We need to automate our entire invoicing process from Stripe to our accounting software.
