This new entry must be suitable for an automated system to use for future, similar inquiries.\n</goal>\n\n<context>\nThis task is part of a 'human-in-the-loop' automated customer support workflow. When the system cannot answer a customer's email using its existing knowledge base (a Google Sheet), the question is forwarded to a human expert. You are now receiving the original question and the expert's reply.\n\nYour generated Q&A pair will be added as a new row to the Google Sheet knowledge base. This will allow the system to answer this question automatically next time.\n\nKey principles to follow:\n1.  **Generalize the Question:** Rephrase the customer's question to be generic and universally applicable. Remove any personal information (names, specific order numbers, account details, etc.) and formulate it as a general query that other customers might ask.\n2.  **Refine the Answer:** Clean up the expert's reply. It should be a complete, well-formatted, and polite response that is ready to be sent directly to a customer without further editing. Remove conversational filler like \"Hi John,\" or \"Hope this helps!\".\n3.  **Capture the Essence:** The final Q&A pair should accurately represent the core problem and its solution.\n</context>\n\n<examples>\n<example_1>\n<inputs>\n<customer_question>\nHi, my name is Jane Doe and I ordered a blue widget last Tuesday (order #12345). I haven't received a shipping confirmation yet. Can you tell me how long shipping usually takes to California? Thanks, Jane\n</customer_question>\n<expert_answer>\nHey Jane, I checked your order. It's currently being processed. For future reference, our standard shipping to the US West Coast is typically 5-7 business days. Cheers.\n</expert_answer>\n</inputs>\n<output>\n{\n  \"question\": \"What are the standard shipping times to the US West Coast?\",\n  \"answer\": \"Standard shipping to the US West Coast typically takes 5-7 business days after your order has been processed. You will receive a shipping confirmation email with a tracking number as soon as your order is dispatched.\"\n}\n</output>\n</example_1>\n\n<example_2>\n<inputs>\n<customer_question>\nI can't find where to reset my API key on my dashboard. I looked in the settings but it's not there. Help!\n</customer_question>\n<expert_answer>\nNo problem. To do that, you need to go to the 'Developer' section, not 'Settings'. From there, you'll see a 'Revoke Key' button. Click that and a new one will be generated for you.\n</expert_answer>\n</inputs>\n<output>\n{\n  \"question\": \"How do I reset my API key?\",\n  \"answer\": \"You can reset your API key by following these steps:\\n1. Log in to your account and navigate to the 'Developer' section in your dashboard.\\n2. Click on the 'Revoke Key' button.\\n3. A new API key will be automatically generated for you.\"\n}\n</output>\n</example_2>\n\n<example_3>\n<inputs>\n<customer_question>\nmy bill is higher this month?? i dont understand why\n</customer_question>\n<expert_answer>\nHi, we recently updated our pricing for the Pro plan from $49/month to $55/month to reflect new features we've added. We sent out an email about this last month. This is the first billing cycle with the new price.\n</expert_answer>\n</inputs>\n<output>\n{\n  \"question\": \"Why did my monthly subscription price increase?\",\n  \"answer\": \"We recently updated our pricing to reflect the addition of new features to our plans. If you have noticed an increase in your monthly bill, it is likely due to this planned pricing adjustment. All users were notified via email prior to the change.\"\n}\n</output>\n</example_3>\n</examples>\n\n\n<output_format>\nYou must provide your response as a single, valid JSON object. The object should contain two keys: \"question\" and \"answer\". Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting around the JSON object.\n\n{\n  \"question\": \"The generated generic question.\",\n  \"answer\": \"The clean, customer-ready answer.\"\n}\n</output_format>\n</instructions>\n\n<inputs>\n<customer_question>\n{{ $('On New Email Received').last().json.text }}\n</customer_question>\n<expert_answer>\n{{ $('Ask Human for Help').last().json.data.text }}\n</expert_answer>\n</inputs>",
